My summary of accomplishments for lab 4:
This lab has some strange errors which I have been trying to fix for some time now. I couldn’t figure out how to do garbage collection so I left that part of the code blank and I couldn’t figure out how to delete a row. The way to run my program is by typing the executable’s name which is simState in this case and then pressing enter. To quit my program hit q and then press enter. What’s strange about my program is that no matter what input I give it, it gives me the finite state machine printed out. It prints out the fsm when I hit p but when I hit q, the program prints the fsm and then exits. I don’t know why this happened. Also, in this lab, I used a lot of nested if statements, I could have been more efficient but due to the midterm season, I did the best I could.
